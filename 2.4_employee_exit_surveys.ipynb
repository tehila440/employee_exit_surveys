    "## Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) and the [Technical and Further Education (TAFE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_and_further_education) institute in Queensland, Australia. Here is the [link](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) to the TAFE exit survey here and the [link](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) to the survey for the DETE here. We've made some slight modifications to these datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first look at the following quesitons:\n",
    "* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to upload the data, explore the columns, clean the data and merge the two datasets."
